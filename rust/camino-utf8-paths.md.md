[camino](https://crates.io/crates/camino) is a crate that provides types for utf-8 paths. `Utf8Path` and `Utf8PathBuf` are like the standard library's [`PathBuf`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/path/struct.PathBuf.html) and [`Path`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/path/struct.Path.html) types, except they are guaranteed to only contain UTF-8 encoded data. Therefore, they expose the ability to get their contents as strings, they implement `Display`, etc.

Camino provides some example for why non-utf8 paths would behave quite strangely and incorrectly and many tools already assume unicode paths. It therefore makes some sense to make life easier by encoding this in the application.

This probably shouldn't be used for system level stuff where non-utf8 paths are quite possible. But for application level stuff, it seems to make sense.
