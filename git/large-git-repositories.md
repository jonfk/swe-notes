# Large Git Repositories

Two Microsoft projects attempt to solve large git repositories. [VFS for git](https://github.com/microsoft/VFSForGit) 
and what seems to be it's successor [Scalar](https://github.com/microsoft/scalar)

Scalar doesn't use virtualization and seems to be a set of tools and configs to optimize git. Have to look more into it.
