The key difference between directors and VPs is accountability level. Directors excel at executing plans with little supervision ("set and forget") - they know how to get things done. VPs, however, are primarily accountable for making the right plan that delivers results. Unlike directors, VPs can't hide behind plan approval if the plan fails - their core responsibility is creating an effective plan in the first place.

The most common development issue is VPs who still think like directors - focusing on execution rather than plan creation and accountability.

Kellogg believes true VPs should risk "being fired now" for refusing to implement a plan they don't believe in rather than "being fired later" for executing a bad plan.
